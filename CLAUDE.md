# Pointers for Claude

- `CONTEXT.md` — domain glossary (Recorder, Bridge, Utterance, Drain, …).
  Use those names; don't introduce shadow vocabulary.
- `.claude/hooks/` — `session-start.sh` installs deps, `stop.sh` runs ruff.
  Convention changes go there or in `pyproject.toml`, not here.
- `bridges/README.md` — Bridge → `/tap` wire contract.

## Security: avoid CodeQL "security-and-quality" tripwires

PRs are scanned by CodeQL with the `security-and-quality` suite (see
`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`). The repo filters out
`py/path-injection` because `tapscribe/sessions.py` already enforces a
strict two-layer path sanitiser — every OTHER rule still runs and
PR authors are expected to land clean. Common trip-wires Claude has
introduced and how to avoid them:

- **Path components from parsed filenames must round-trip through
  `safe_name`** before being interpolated into a new path. Even when
  the source filename came from a validated `session_dir.glob("*.wav")`
  walk, CodeQL's intraprocedural analysis can't see the upstream
  containment check. Both the live `/tap` recorder
  (`tapscribe/tap_fan_out.py`) and the strip-silence splitter
  (`tapscribe/sessions.py`) build filenames via
  `tapscribe.text.build_recorder_wav_name`, which applies `safe_name`
  internally — use that helper, don't build the filename yourself.
- **Subprocess argv must always be the list form** (`subprocess.Popen([
  exe, "--flag", value])`) — never `shell=True`, never an f-string.
  `tapscribe.live.build_live_cmd` is the only place that constructs
  argv; new flags go there, with each value `str()`-converted at the
  call site.
- **Never widen `query-filters` in the CodeQL config to silence a new
  finding.** Every exclude has a written justification block; the bar
  for a third one is high. Fix the code instead.
- **CLI parsers (argparse, etc.) flow into many places** — even though
  the operator launches the recorder, CodeQL treats argparse values as
  external input. Constrain with `choices=` / `type=int` / `type=float`
  where possible; defensive validation at the boundary keeps the rest
  of the codebase clean.
- **Every `except: pass` (and `except Foo: pass`) needs an explanatory
  comment inside the body** explaining *why* swallowing is the correct
  behaviour. CodeQL's `py/empty-except` flags bare passes, and the
  reviewer asks for justification on every PR that ships one. Don't
  ship `except Foo: pass` — write `except Foo:` then a comment saying
  what raises it, why suppression is intentional, and what's lost when
  it's swallowed. If suppression is *not* the right behaviour, log or
  re-raise instead.

## Verify before claiming green: actually run every CI job locally

CI has multiple jobs and they don't all run by default. **Skipped tests
do not count as passing tests.** Before claiming `pytest tests/e2e` is
green, check what's in the CI matrix you're not running:

- `pytest --ignore=tests/e2e ...` runs the Python unit suite.
- `pytest tests/e2e -k 'not real_whisper'` is **incomplete** on this dev
  box because `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_ui.py` silently skips itself
  (`pytest.skip(... allow_module_level=True)`) when playwright isn't
  importable. The CI job *does* install playwright and runs every test
  in that file. Without playwright locally you'll never see a real-DOM
  regression — the suite will just print `1 skipped`.
- The dashboard-UI CI job runs `pytest tests/e2e/test_dashboard_ui.py
  -q -m "not real_audio"`. Run the same locally before pushing.

### Local playwright setup

This dev box ships Chromium under `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/`.
Playwright matches its bundled Chromium revision to the playwright
package version, so version drift between `pip install playwright`
(latest) and the on-disk browser is the standard failure mode
("Executable doesn't exist at /opt/pw-browsers/chromium_headless_shell-<N>/...").

The on-disk revision `1194` matches **playwright 1.56.x**. To bring up
the playwright tests:

```bash
pip install 'playwright==1.56.*'
export PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers
pytest tests/e2e/test_dashboard_ui.py -m 'not real_audio'
```

`playwright install chromium` will fail (no outbound network); don't
try. If the on-disk revision changes, mismatched-version errors tell
you which version Playwright is looking for — bump the pip install to
match.

### When CI flips red on a dashboard test, suspect import hygiene

The dashboard JS swallows exceptions thrown inside addEventListener
callbacks; a `ReferenceError` from a removed-but-still-used import will
*not* surface as a pageerror, the unit test suite will pass, and only
the playwright job catches it. After any refactor in
`tapscribe/web/js/components/session-detail.js` that touches the
top-of-file `import { ... } from "../templates.js"`, grep the file for
every name you removed (`grep -n '\bslot('`, etc.) before pushing —
helpers used by `buildExpandTx`, the regex tester, and other rarely
exercised paths are easy to miss when ripping unused-looking names.
