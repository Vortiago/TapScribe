# Pointers for Claude

- `CONTEXT.md` — domain glossary (Recorder, Bridge, Utterance, Drain, …).
  Use those names; don't introduce shadow vocabulary.
- `.claude/hooks/` — `session-start.sh` installs deps, `stop.sh` runs ruff.
  Convention changes go there or in `pyproject.toml`, not here.
- `bridges/README.md` — Bridge → `/tap` wire contract.

## Security: avoid CodeQL "security-and-quality" tripwires

PRs are scanned by CodeQL with the `security-and-quality` suite (see
`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`). The repo filters out
`py/path-injection` because `tapscribe/sessions.py` already enforces a
strict two-layer path sanitiser — every OTHER rule still runs and
PR authors are expected to land clean. Common trip-wires Claude has
introduced and how to avoid them:

- **Path components from parsed filenames must round-trip through
  `safe_name`** before being interpolated into a new path. Even when
  the source filename came from a validated `session_dir.glob("*.wav")`
  walk, CodeQL's intraprocedural analysis can't see the upstream
  containment check. Both the live `/tap` recorder
  (`tapscribe/tap_fan_out.py`) and the strip-silence splitter
  (`tapscribe/sessions.py`) build filenames via
  `tapscribe.text.build_recorder_wav_name`, which applies `safe_name`
  internally — use that helper, don't build the filename yourself.
- **Subprocess argv must always be the list form** (`subprocess.Popen([
  exe, "--flag", value])`) — never `shell=True`, never an f-string.
  `tapscribe.live.build_live_cmd` is the only place that constructs
  argv; new flags go there, with each value `str()`-converted at the
  call site.
- **Never widen `query-filters` in the CodeQL config to silence a new
  finding.** Every exclude has a written justification block; the bar
  for a third one is high. Fix the code instead.
- **CLI parsers (argparse, etc.) flow into many places** — even though
  the operator launches the recorder, CodeQL treats argparse values as
  external input. Constrain with `choices=` / `type=int` / `type=float`
  where possible; defensive validation at the boundary keeps the rest
  of the codebase clean.
- **Every `except: pass` (and `except Foo: pass`) needs an explanatory
  comment inside the body** explaining *why* swallowing is the correct
  behaviour. CodeQL's `py/empty-except` flags bare passes, and the
  reviewer asks for justification on every PR that ships one. Don't
  ship `except Foo: pass` — write `except Foo:` then a comment saying
  what raises it, why suppression is intentional, and what's lost when
  it's swallowed. If suppression is *not* the right behaviour, log or
  re-raise instead.
