# Pointers for Claude

- `CONTEXT.md` — domain glossary (Recorder, Bridge, Utterance, Drain, …).
  Use those names; don't introduce shadow vocabulary.
- `.claude/hooks/` — `session-start.sh` installs deps, `stop.sh` runs ruff.
  Convention changes go there or in `pyproject.toml`, not here.
- `bridges/README.md` — Bridge → `/tap` wire contract.
